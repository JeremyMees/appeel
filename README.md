## ES6+ functions

- Filter -> I used the filter function to filter the commits on there messages. The reason that I used the filter function is beceause it's the most compact way to filter an array that I know of.
- Arrow functions -> I use arrow functions all the time. I think it's the cleanest way to write functions. It removes unnecessary syntax that you have to write with a normal function
